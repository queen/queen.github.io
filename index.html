                    Hello, I'm Sai and I'm an 18-year-old exploit hunter and reverse engineer. I'm currently working on Minecraft exploitation - although I have a lot of experience with
                    low-level programming as well as reverse engineering. I am currently not taking commissions or anything similar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of penetration testing, I enjoy gaming - although I'm still learning to balance myself properly so my days are usually one or the other.
                </p>

                    Although my work for this may never be FULLY visible. I have worked together with Hypixel Administrators to patch some of the most threatening bugs to the game - I aim to continue this further and continue with this journey - as it's what I find most fun.

                    Worked together with a team of very talented reversers in order to create the first Private Server implementation for this game through analyzing protocol and dumping the insanely complicated encrypted IL2CPP assemblies.
